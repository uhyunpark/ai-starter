description: Create and manage Claude Code skills following Anthropic best practices. Use when creating new skills, modifying skill-rules.json, understanding trigger patterns, working with hooks, debugging skill activation, or implementing progressive disclosure. Covers skill structure, YAML frontmatter, trigger types (keywords, intent patterns, file paths, content patterns), enforcement levels (block, suggest, warn), hook mechanisms (UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse), session tracking, and the 500-line rule.

# Skill Developer Guide

## Purpose

Comprehensive guide for creating and managing skills in Claude Code with auto-activation system, following Anthropic's official best practices including the 500-line rule and progressive disclosure pattern.

## When to Use This Skill

Automatically activates when you mention:
- Creating or adding skills
- Modifying skill triggers or rules
- Understanding how skill activation works
- Debugging skill activation issues
- Working with skill-rules.json
- Hook system mechanics
- Claude Code best practices
- Progressive disclosure
- YAML frontmatter
- 500-line rule

---

## System Overview

### Two-Hook Architecture

**1. UserPromptSubmit Hook** (Proactive Suggestions)
- **Trigger**: BEFORE Claude sees user's prompt
- **Purpose**: Suggest relevant skills based on keywords + intent patterns
- **Method**: Injects formatted reminder as context (stdout -> Claude's input)
- **Use Cases**: Topic-based skills, implicit work detection

**2. PreToolUse Hook** (Guardrails)
- **Trigger**: BEFORE a tool executes
- **Purpose**: Block dangerous operations until skill is consulted
- **Method**: Exit code 2 blocks tool, stderr -> Claude
- **Use Cases**: Database verification, critical safety checks

### Configuration File

**Location**: `.claude/skills/skill-rules.json`

Defines:
- All skills and their trigger conditions
- Enforcement levels (block, suggest, warn)
- File path patterns (glob)
- Content detection patterns (regex)
- Skip conditions (session tracking, file markers, env vars)

---

## Skill Types

### 1. Guardrail Skills

**Purpose:** Enforce critical best practices that prevent errors

**Characteristics:**
- Type: `"guardrail"`
- Enforcement: `"block"`
- Priority: `"critical"` or `"high"`
- Block file edits until skill used
- Prevent common mistakes (column names, critical errors)
- Session-aware (don't repeat nag in same session)

**When to Use:**
- Mistakes that cause runtime errors
- Data integrity concerns
- Critical compatibility issues

### 2. Domain Skills

**Purpose:** Provide comprehensive guidance for specific areas

**Characteristics:**
- Type: `"domain"`
- Enforcement: `"suggest"`
- Priority: `"high"` or `"medium"`
- Advisory, not mandatory
- Topic or domain-specific
- Comprehensive documentation

**When to Use:**
- Complex systems requiring deep knowledge
- Best practices documentation
- Architectural patterns
- How-to guides

## Quick Start: Creating a New Skill

### Step 1: Create Skill File

**Location:** `.claude/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`

**Template:**
```markdown
---
name: my-new-skill
description: Brief description including keywords that trigger this skill. Mention topics, file types, and use cases. Be explicit about trigger terms.
---

# My New Skill

## Purpose
What this skill helps with

## When to Use
Specific scenarios and conditions

## Key Information
The actual guidance, documentation, patterns, examples
```

**Best Practices:**
- Name: Lowercase, hyphens, gerund form (verb + -ing) preferred
- Description: Include ALL trigger keywords/phrases (max 1024 chars)
- Content: Under 500 lines - use reference files for details
- Examples: Real code examples
- Structure: Clear headings, lists, code blocks

### Step 2: Add to skill-rules.json

See [SKILL_RULES_REFERENCE.md](SKILL_RULES_REFERENCE.md) for complete schema.

**Basic Template:**
```json
{
  "my-new-skill": {
    "type": "domain",
    "enforcement": "suggest",
    "priority": "medium",
    "promptTriggers": {
      "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2"],
      "intentPatterns": ["(create|add).*?something"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Follow Anthropic Best Practices

- Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines
- Use progressive disclosure with reference files
- Add table of contents to reference files > 100 lines
- Write detailed description with trigger keywords
- Test with 3+ real scenarios before documenting
- Iterate based on actual usage

---

## Enforcement Levels

### BLOCK (Critical Guardrails)

- Physically prevents Edit/Write tool execution
- Exit code 2 from hook, stderr -> Claude
- Claude sees message and must use skill to proceed
- **Use For**: Critical mistakes, data integrity, security issues

### SUGGEST (Recommended)

- Reminder injected before Claude sees prompt
- Claude is aware of relevant skills
- Not enforced, just advisory
- **Use For**: Domain guidance, best practices, how-to guides

### WARN (Optional)

- Low priority suggestions
- Advisory only, minimal enforcement
- **Use For**: Nice-to-have suggestions, informational reminders

---

## Skip Conditions & User Control

### 1. Session Tracking

**Purpose:** Don't nag repeatedly in same session

**How it works:**
- First edit -> Hook blocks, updates session state
- Second edit (same session) -> Hook allows
- Different session -> Blocks again

### 2. File Markers

**Purpose:** Permanent skip for verified files

**Marker:** `// @skip-validation`

**NOTE:** Use sparingly - defeats the purpose if overused

### 3. Environment Variables

**Purpose:** Emergency disable, temporary override

**Global disable:**
```bash
export SKIP_SKILL_GUARDRAILS=true  # Disables ALL PreToolUse blocks
```

---

## Quick Reference Summary

### Create New Skill (5 Steps)

1. Create `.claude/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` with frontmatter
2. Add entry to `.claude/skills/skill-rules.json`
3. Test with real prompts
4. Refine patterns based on testing
5. Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines

### Trigger Types

- **Keywords**: Explicit topic mentions
- **Intent**: Implicit action detection
- **File Paths**: Location-based activation
- **Content**: Technology-specific detection

See [TRIGGER_TYPES.md](TRIGGER_TYPES.md) for complete details.

### Enforcement

- **BLOCK**: Exit code 2, critical only
- **SUGGEST**: Inject context, most common
- **WARN**: Advisory, rarely used

### Anthropic Best Practices

- **500-line rule**: Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines
- **Progressive disclosure**: Use reference files for details
- **Table of contents**: Add to reference files > 100 lines
- **One level deep**: Don't nest references deeply
- **Rich descriptions**: Include all trigger keywords (max 1024 chars)
- **Test first**: Build 3+ evaluations before extensive documentation
- **Gerund naming**: Prefer verb + -ing (e.g., "processing-pdfs")
